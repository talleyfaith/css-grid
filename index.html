      <p>I have been drawing since a very young age. While I don't intend to go professional, it's very rewarding to work hard and improve my skills. I'm very passionate about all types of art though. I also play the ukulele and sing, and I've even acted before.</p>
      <p>Focusing on the visual arts, for the second year now I've participated in Inktober. It's a month-long challenge in October to draw on paper using only ink. This year is going very well so far.</p>
