      <p>Welcome to my personal page-- here you can view some of my current interests, and find out how you can get into them too.</p>
      <p>Hobbies are very important to personal health. They are a good and consistent way of having fun. As they say-- all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!</p>

      <p>I have been drawing since a very young age. While I don't intend to go professional, it's very rewarding to work hard and improve my skills. I'm very passionate about all types of art though. I also play the ukulele and sing, and I've even acted before.</p>
      <p>Focusing on the visual arts, for the second year now I've participated in Inktober. It's a month-long challenge in October to draw on paper using only ink. This year is going very well so far.</p>

      <p>Video games are a very fun and engaging experience. I don't all the games pictured, but I do know about them or am interested in them. I haven't always been interested in video games. They are definitely a more recent hobby.</p>
      <p>However, games have always been a part of my childhood. My family members always bought games and consoles. It just wasn't until I was older that I could have my own.</p>
