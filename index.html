      <p>Big cities are great. I love big cities. I want to live in a big city. Wouldn't it be great if we all could live in one? Some people like rural life better. But I am best accustomed to cities. I like New York, Austin, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. These are some of my favorite cities.</p>
